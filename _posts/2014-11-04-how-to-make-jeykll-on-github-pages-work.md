#Why Jeykll on GitHub Pages

1, It is free

2, It has not been blocked inside mainland China

3, It is common in the IT cycle. (This is a tech blog in financial area)

#Steps on installation and setup of Jekyll

1, install ruby/ruby-dev/rubygems

	sudo apt-get install ruby
	sudo apt-get install ruby-dev

note: since rubygems version number updates all the time, it is better to install it manaully. [1]

2, install a javascript runtime if not

	sudo apt-get install nodejs

3, install jekyll

	sudo apt-get jekyll

4, run it locally[2]

	jekyll new test_site
	cd test_site
	jekyll server

#Why you need to install jekyll locally

You would like to make sure your site works before you push it to GitHub, because sometimes GitHub email does not tell you the detailed error.

# It is better to clone Jekyll-bootstrap
